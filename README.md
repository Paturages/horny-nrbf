# horny-nrbf

A really hacky broken ass partially working NRBF viewer born from trying to pry Trombone Champ files open.

This was tested with:
- `TromboneChamp\TromboneChamp_Data\StreamingAssets\leveldata\songdata.tchamp`
- `TromboneChamp\TromboneChamp_Data\StreamingAssets\leveldata\*.tmb`
- Recent Clone Hero PTB song caches (I don't know where they are, I don't play anymore)

This was prototyped in [one single plain JS file](blob/main/src/nrbf.js) in about a dead workday or so uh, here be dragons.

The implementation is wildly incomplete, so your mileage may vary outside of the aforementioned use cases.
